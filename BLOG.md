Discovering unmanaged APIs using API Connect - new feature

We are talking about APIC Discovery, a new feature of API Connect available only on the SaaS instances. 
Basically it can get a streamline of unmanaged APIs from static sources and recreate API contract from runtime data.

USE CASES

API discovery uses data source collectors that are placed onto gateways and ingresses to give you the visibility of the API traffic in your networks. 
The logs from this traffic are forwarded to the discovery capability, analyzed, and then API documents are generated and presented for review. 
These generated API documents can then be copied to draft APIs as required, to enable full lifecycle management and securely socializing them.

The following types of data source collectors are supported:

- GitHub
- DataPowerÂ® API Gateway proxy
- OpenTelemetry
